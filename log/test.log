• Fitting this ODE model with saemix takes about 5 minutes on my new system
  (1): 'test_dmta.R:88:3'
• Fitting with saemix takes around 10 minutes when using deSolve (1):
  'test_mixed.R:80:3'
• This is seldom used, so save some time (1): 'test_mixed.R:135:3'
• This still takes almost 2.5 minutes although we do not solve ODEs (1):
  'test_saemix_parent.R:143:3'
