Description: Calculation routines based on the FOCUS Kinetics Report (2006).
  Includes a function for conveniently defining differential equation models,
  model solution based on eigenvalues if possible or using numerical solvers
  and a choice of the optimisation methods made available by the FME package.
  If the ccSolve package and a C compiler is available, differential equation
  models are solved as compiled C functions.
  Please note that no warranty is implied for correctness of results or fitness
  for a particular purpose.
