Description: Calculation routines based on the FOCUS Kinetics Report (2006,
  2014).  Includes a function for conveniently defining differential equation
  models, model solution based on eigenvalues if possible or using numerical
  solvers and a choice of the optimisation methods made available by the 'FME'
  package.  If a C compiler (on windows: 'Rtools') is installed, differential
  equation models are solved using compiled C functions.  Please note that no
  warranty is implied for correctness of results or fitness for a particular
  purpose.
Depends: minpack.lm, rootSolve, inline, parallel
Imports: stats, graphics, methods, FME, deSolve, R6
Suggests: knitr, testthat, microbenchmark, ggplot2, tikzDevice
