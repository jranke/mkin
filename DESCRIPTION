Description: Calculation routines based on the FOCUS Kinetics Report (2006,
  2014).  Includes a function for conveniently defining differential equation
  models, model solution based on eigenvalues if possible or using numerical
  solvers.  If a C compiler (on windows: 'Rtools') is installed, differential
  equation models are solved using automatically generated C functions.
  Heteroscedasticity can be taken into account using variance by variable or
  two-component error models as described by Ranke and Meinecke (2018)
  <doi:10.3390/environments6120124>.  Hierarchical degradation models can
  be fitted using nonlinear mixed-effects model packages as a back end as
  described by Ranke et al. (2021) <doi:10.3390/environments8080071>.  Please
  note that no warranty is implied for correctness of results or fitness for a
  particular purpose.
