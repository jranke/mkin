Description: Calculation routines based on the FOCUS Kinetics Report (2006,
  2014).  Includes a function for conveniently defining differential equation
  models, model solution based on eigenvalues if possible or using numerical
  solvers.  If a C compiler (on windows: 'Rtools') is installed, differential
  equation models are solved using automatically generated C functions.
  Heteroscedasticity can be taken into account using variance by variable or
  two-component error models as described by Ranke and Meinecke (2018)
  <doi:10.3390/environments6120124>.  Interfaces to several nonlinear
  mixed-effects model packages are available, some of which are described by
  Ranke et al. (2021) <doi:10.3390/environments8080071>.  Please note that no
  warranty is implied for correctness of results or fitness for a particular
  purpose.
