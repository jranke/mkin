Description: Calculation routines based on the FOCUS Kinetics Report (2006). Includes 
  a function for conveniently defining differential equation models, choice of
  the optimisation methods made available by the FME package (default is a
  Levenberg-Marquardt variant). Initial values for parameters of the differential
  equations and time zero values of the state values can be defaults, user defined
  or a combination of a fit for the parent compound carried out by the kinfit
  package and defaults. DT50 and DT90 values are calculated as well as the 
  chi2 error level as defined by the FOCUS Kinetics Group.
