#' Transform formation fractions as in the first published mkin version
#'
#' The transformed fractions can be restricted between 0 and 1 in model
#' optimisations. Therefore this transformation was used originally in mkin. It
#' was later replaced by the [ilr] transformation because the ilr transformed
#' fractions can assumed to follow normal distribution. As the ilr
#' transformation is not available in [RxODE] and can therefore not be used in
#' the nlmixr modelling language, this transformation is currently used for
#' translating mkin models with formation fractions to more than one target
#' compartment for fitting with nlmixr in [nlmixr_model]. However,
#' this implementation cannot be used there, as it is not accessible
#' from RxODE.
