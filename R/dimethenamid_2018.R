#'  Aerobic soil degradation data on dimethenamid and dimethenamid-P from the EU assessment in 2018
#'
#' The datasets were extracted from the active substance evaluation dossier
#' published by EFSA. Kinetic evaluations shown for these datasets are intended
#' to illustrate and advance kinetic modelling. The fact that these data and
#' some results are shown here does not imply a license to use them in the
#' context of pesticide  registrations, as the use of the data may be
#' constrained by data protection regulations.

#' The R code used to create this data object is installed with this package
#' in the 'dataset_generation' directory. In the code, page numbers are given for
#' specific pieces of information in the comments.
