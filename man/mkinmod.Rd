\title{Function to set up a kinetic model with one or more state variables}
\usage{
mkinmod(
  ...,
  use_of_ff = "max",
  name = NULL,
  speclist = NULL,
  quiet = FALSE,
  verbose = FALSE,
  dll_dir = NULL,
  unload = FALSE,
  overwrite = FALSE
)

\method{print}{mkinmod}(x, ...)

mkinsub(submodel, to = NULL, sink = TRUE, full_name = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{For each observed variable, a list as obtained by \code{\link[=mkinsub]{mkinsub()}}
has to be specified as an argument (see examples).  Currently, single
first order kinetics "SFO", indeterminate order rate equation kinetics
"IORE", or single first order with reversible binding "SFORB" are
implemented for all variables, while "FOMC", "DFOP", "HS" and "logistic"
can additionally be chosen for the first variable which is assumed to be
the source compartment.
Additionally, \code{\link[=mkinsub]{mkinsub()}} has an argument \code{to}, specifying names of
variables to which a transfer is to be assumed in the model.
If the argument \code{use_of_ff} is set to "min"
and the model for the compartment is "SFO" or "SFORB", an
additional \code{\link[=mkinsub]{mkinsub()}} argument can be \code{sink = FALSE}, effectively
fixing the flux to sink to zero.
In print.mkinmod, this argument is currently not used.}

\item{use_of_ff}{Specification of the use of formation fractions in the
model equations and, if applicable, the coefficient matrix.  If "max",
formation fractions are always used (default).  If "min", a minimum use of
formation fractions is made, i.e. each first-order pathway to a metabolite
has its own rate constant.}

\item{name}{A name for the model. Should be a valid R object name.}

\item{speclist}{The specification of the observed variables and their
submodel types and pathways can be given as a single list using this
argument. Default is NULL.}

\item{quiet}{Should messages be suppressed?}

\item{verbose}{If \code{TRUE}, passed to \code{\link[inline:cfunction]{inline::cfunction()}} if
applicable to give detailed information about the C function being built.}

\item{dll_dir}{Directory where an DLL object, if generated internally by
\code{\link[inline:cfunction]{inline::cfunction()}}, should be saved.  The DLL will only be stored in a
permanent location for use in future sessions, if 'dll_dir' and 'name'
are specified. This is helpful if fit objects are cached e.g. by knitr,
as the cache remains functional across sessions if the DLL is stored in
a user defined location.}

\item{unload}{If a DLL from the target location in 'dll_dir' is already
loaded, should that be unloaded first?}

\item{overwrite}{If a file exists at the target DLL location in 'dll_dir',
should this be overwritten?}

\item{x}{An \code{\link{mkinmod}} object.}

\item{submodel}{Character vector of length one to specify the submodel type.
See \code{\link{mkinmod}} for the list of allowed submodel names.}

\item{to}{Vector of the names of the state variable to which a
transformation shall be included in the model.}

\item{sink}{Should a pathway to sink be included in the model in addition to
the pathways to other state variables?}

\item{full_name}{An optional name to be used e.g. for plotting fits
performed with the model.  You can use non-ASCII characters here, but then
your R code will not be portable, \emph{i.e.} may produce unintended plot
results on other operating systems or system configurations.}
}
\value{
A list of class \code{mkinmod} for use with \code{\link[=mkinfit]{mkinfit()}},
containing, among others,
\item{diffs}{
A vector of string representations of differential equations, one for
each modelling variable.
}
\item{map}{
A list containing named character vectors for each observed variable,
specifying the modelling variables by which it is represented.
}
\item{use_of_ff}{
The content of \code{use_of_ff} is passed on in this list component.
}
\item{deg_func}{
If generated, a function containing the solution of the degradation
model.
}
\item{coefmat}{
The coefficient matrix, if the system of differential equations can be
represented by one.
}
\item{cf}{
If generated, a compiled function calculating the derivatives as
returned by cfunction.
}

A list for use with \code{\link{mkinmod}}.
}
\description{
This function is usually called using a call to \code{\link[=mkinsub]{mkinsub()}} for each observed
variable, specifying the corresponding submodel as well as outgoing pathways
(see examples).

Print mkinmod objects in a way that the user finds his way to get to its
components.
}
\details{
For the definition of model types and their parameters, the equations given
in the FOCUS and NAFTA guidance documents are used.

For kinetic models with more than one observed variable, a symbolic solution
of the system of differential equations is included in the resulting
mkinmod object in some cases, speeding up the solution.

If a C compiler is found by \code{\link[pkgbuild:has_compiler]{pkgbuild::has_compiler()}} and there
is more than one observed variable in the specification, C code is generated
for evaluating the differential equations, compiled using
\code{\link[inline:cfunction]{inline::cfunction()}} and added to the resulting mkinmod object.
}
\note{
The IORE submodel is not well tested for metabolites. When using this
model for metabolites, you may want to read the note in the help
page to \link{mkinfit}.
