\description{
The five datasets were extracted from the active substance evaluation dossier
published by EFSA. Kinetic evaluations shown for these datasets are intended
to illustrate and advance kinetic modelling. The fact that these data and
some results are shown here does not imply a license to use them in the
context of pesticide  registrations, as the use of the data may be
constrained by data protection regulations.
}
\details{
Data for the first dataset are from p. 685. Data for the other four
datasets were used in the preprocessed versions given in the kinetics
section (p. 761ff.), with the exception of residues smaller than 1 for DCP
in the soil from Site I2, where the values given on p. 694 were used.

The R code used to create this data object is installed with this package
in the 'dataset_generation' directory. In the code, page numbers are given for
specific pieces of information in the comments.
