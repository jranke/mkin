\title{Function to plot residuals stored in an mkin object}
\usage{
mkinresplot(
  object,
  obs_vars = names(object$mkinmod$map),
  xlim = c(0, 1.1 * max(object$data$time)),
  standardized = FALSE,
  xlab = "Time",
  ylab = ifelse(standardized, "Standardized residual", "Residual"),
  maxabs = "auto",
  legend = TRUE,
  lpos = "topright",
  col_obs = "auto",
  pch_obs = "auto",
  frame = TRUE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A fit represented in an \code{\link{mkinfit}} object.}

\item{obs_vars}{A character vector of names of the observed variables for
which residuals should be plotted. Defaults to all observed variables in
the model}

\item{xlim}{plot range in x direction.}

\item{standardized}{Should the residuals be standardized by dividing by the
standard deviation given by the error model of the fit?}

\item{xlab}{Label for the x axis.}

\item{ylab}{Label for the y axis.}

\item{maxabs}{Maximum absolute value of the residuals. This is used for the
scaling of the y axis and defaults to "auto".}

\item{legend}{Should a legend be plotted?}

\item{lpos}{Where should the legend be placed? Default is "topright". Will
be passed on to \code{\link{legend}}.}

\item{col_obs}{Colors for the observed variables.}

\item{pch_obs}{Symbols to be used for the observed variables.}

\item{frame}{Should a frame be drawn around the plots?}

\item{\dots}{further arguments passed to \code{\link{plot}}.}
}
\value{
Nothing is returned by this function, as it is called for its side
effect, namely to produce a plot.
}
\description{
This function plots the residuals for the specified subset of the observed
variables from an mkinfit object. A combined plot of the fitted model and
the residuals can be obtained using \code{\link{plot.mkinfit}} using the
argument \code{show_residuals = TRUE}.
}
\examples{

model <- mkinmod(parent = mkinsub("SFO", "m1"), m1 = mkinsub("SFO"))
fit <- mkinfit(model, FOCUS_2006_D, quiet = TRUE)
mkinresplot(fit, "m1")

}
\seealso{
\code{\link{mkinplot}}, for a way to plot the data and the fitted
lines of the mkinfit object, and \code{\link{plot_res}} for a function
combining the plot of the fit and the residual plot.
